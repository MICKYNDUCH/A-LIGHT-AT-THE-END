                The <strong> <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Joshua%206%3A1-21&version=NKJV">Wall of Jericho</a></strong> was an impenetrable force to any army that was trying to overcome the city. Before even dealing with the wall , the attacking troops would have to navigate their way across the <span>27feet</span> wide <span>9 feet</span> deep pit that outline the outer edge of the city. Then there was the wall itself ,<span>17 feet </span> high,<span>5 feet</span> wide pure mass of solid stone. If the attacking troops would manage to get through this without getting shoot down by archers, all that was left was to defeat the well trained <strong> <a href="https://www.livescience.com/56016-canaanites.html">Canaanite Army</a></strong> that was waiting within.

            <P>
                This was a reality of a young leader named <span>Joshua</span> and his rag-tag <strong> <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Israelite">Israelites Army</a></strong>, this Israelites who had seen an entire generation live and die while wondering through the desert were tired, hungry and face what seemed like an impossible task <q>A HOPELESS SITUATION</q>.
                Now I haven't lived long, but I have lived long enough to know this, that running into <em>Walls</em> is a part of life , and the bigger the wall, the more hopeless the situation can seem. The large wall of <strong>Sickness, Loss, Divorce</strong> they pop-up  around us and they seem <i>Impenetrable</i> and just like the wall at Jericho, this walls rarely stand alone. The wall of our life are often covered with deep pain of <strong>Suffering </strong> and <strong>Despair</strong> and an army of hopelessness covers us on every side.

                The question is asked all the time. <q> <em>If <strong>GOD</strong> loves us so much and is so powerful ,then why does he allow this walls to pop-up around me?</em></q>. Now I don't pretend to have the answers to any of this questions nor do I pretend to know how deep your suffering has been, all I simply want to suggest is ,<q>Maybe God does his work from seemingly hopeless situation</q> ,When I read the bible ,i read about people and characters who all faced a seemingly hopeless situation. In fact,I cannot find a single person who walked faithful with God without first facing a hopeless situation.

        But if there is one thing we learn about the <strong> <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/">Scriptures</a></strong>, is that we cannot place a period ( <strong>.</strong> ) where <strong>God</strong> has place a comma ( <strong>,</strong> ). because when all other options are worn out ,when circumstances couldn't get worse and when everything else has failed. Get ready because that is exactly where <strong>God</strong> show up.

        <p>His power is made perfect in weakness, so let us rejoice in our trials and stay strong in the hope that we profess, because he who promised is faithful,was faithful and will always be faithful no matter the situation. </p>
