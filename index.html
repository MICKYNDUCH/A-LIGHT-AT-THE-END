    <P>
        The wall of Jericho was an impenetrable force to any army that was trying to overcome the city. Before even dealing with the wall , the attacking troops would have to navigate their way across the 27feet wide 9 feet deep pit that outline the outer edge of the city. Then there was the wall itself , 17 feet high,5 feet wide pure mass of solid stone. If the attacking troops would manage to get through this without getting shoot down by archers, all that was left was to defeat the well trained Canaanite army that was waiting within.
